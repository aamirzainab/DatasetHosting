VAST,2006,Pixnostics: Towards Measuring the Value of Visualization,10.1109/vast.2006.261423,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2006.261423,199.0,206.0,C,"During the last two decades a wide variety of advanced methods for the visual exploration of large data sets have been proposed. For most of these techniques user interaction has become a crucial element, since there are many situations in which a user or an analyst has to select the right parameter settings from among many or select a subset of the available attribute space for the visualization process, in order to construct valuable visualizations that provide insight, into the data and reveal interesting patterns. The right choice of input parameters is often essential, since suboptimal parameter settings or the investigation of irrelevant data dimensions make the exploration process more time consuming and may result in wrong conclusions. In this paper we propose a novel method for automatically determining meaningful parameter- and attribute settings based on the information content of the resulting visualizations. Our technique called Pixnostics, in analogy to Scagnostics (Wilkinson et al., 2005), automatically analyses pixel images resulting from diverse parameter mappings and ranks them according to the potential value for the user. This allows a more effective and more efficient visual data analysis process, since the attribute/parameter space is reduced to meaningful selections and thus the analyst obtains faster insight into the data. Real world applications are provided to show the benefit of the proposed approach",Jörn Schneidewind;Mike Sips;Daniel A. Keim,Jorn Schneidewind;Mike Sips;Daniel A.

In 2001, Barnes and Roeder defined a set of contours corresponding to compositional fields for spinel group minerals. Geologists typically use this contours to estimate the tectonic environment where a particular spinel composition could have been formed. This task is prone to errors and requires tedious manual comparison of overlapping diagrams. We introduce a semi-automatic, interactive detection of tectonic settings for an arbitrary dataset based on the Barnes and Roeder contours. The new approach integrates the mentioned contours and includes a novel interaction called contour brush.

Specialized interactive visual methods are required to help analysts in understanding the characteristics of the attributes when these multiple aspects are considered concurrently. Here, we develop attribute signatures-interactively crafted graphics that show the geographic variability of statistics of attributes through which the extent of dependency between the attributes and geography can be visually explored. We compute a number of statistical measures, which can also account for variations in time and scale, and use them as a basis for our visualizations. We then employ different graphical configurations to show and compare both continuous and discrete variation of location and scale.

Through a fast computational simulation method inspired by the behavior of Physarum polycephalum, an unicellular slime mold organism that efficiently forages for nutrients, astrophysicists are able to extrapolate from sparse datasets, such as galaxy maps archived in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and then use these extrapolations to inform analyses of a wide range of other data, such as spectroscopic observations captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Researchers can interactively update the simulation by adjusting model parameters, and then investigate the resulting visual output to form hypotheses about the data.

Existing distance functions assess the similarity between trajectories based on properties of the trajectory points or segments. The properties may include the spatial positions, times, and thematic attributes. There may be a need to focus the analysis on certain parts of trajectories, i.e., points and segments that have particular properties. According to the analysis focus, the analyst may need to cluster trajectories by similarity of their relevant parts only. Throughout the analysis process, the focus may change, and different parts of trajectories may become relevant. We propose an analytical workflow in which interactive filtering tools are used to attach relevance flags to elements of trajectories, clustering is done using a distance function that ignores irrelevant elements, and the resulting clusters are summarized for further analysis. We demonstrate how this workflow can be useful for different analysis tasks in three case studies with real data from the domain of air traffic.

We previously proposed an extrema graph method (T. Itoh and K. Koyamada, 1995), which generates a graph connecting extremum points. The isosurface propagation starts from some of the intersected cells that are found both by visiting the cells through which arcs of the graph pass and by visiting the cells on the boundary of a volume. We propose an efficient method of searching for cells intersected by an isosurface. This method generates a volumetric skeleton. consisting of cells, like an extrema graph, by applying a thinning algorithm used in the image recognition area.

Due to the reduced field of view during the intervention, the surgeons have less information about the surrounding structures in the working area compared to open surgery. Virtual endoscopy enables the visualization of the operating field and additional information, such as risk structures (e.g., optical nerve and skull base) and target structures to be removed (e.g., mucosal swelling). The Sinus Endoscopy system provides the functional range of a virtual endoscopic system with special focus on a realistic representation. Furthermore, by using direct volume rendering, we avoid time-consuming segmentation steps for the use of individual patient datasets. However, the image quality of the endoscopic view can be adjusted in a way that a standard computer with a modern standard graphics card achieves interactive frame rates with low CPU utilization. Thereby, characteristics of the endoscopic view are systematically used for the optimization of the volume rendering speed. The system design was based on a careful analysis of the endoscopic sinus surgery and the resulting needs for computer support. As a small standalone application it can be instantly used for surgical planning and patient education. First results of a clinical evaluation with ENT surgeons were employed to fine-tune the user interface, in particular to reduce the number of controls by using appropriate default values wherever possible. The system was used for preoperative planning in 102 cases, provides useful information for intervention planning (e.g., anatomic variations of the Rec.

However, analysts are usually unaware of how well the abstracted data represent the original dataset, which can impact the reliability of results gleaned from the abstractions. In this paper, we define two data abstraction quality measures for computing the degree to which the abstraction conveys the original dataset: the histogram difference measure and the nearest neighbor measure. They have been integrated within XmdvTool, a public-domain multiresolution visualization system for multivariate data analysis that supports sampling as well as clustering to simplify data. Several interactive operations are provided, including adjusting the data abstraction level, changing selected regions, and setting the acceptable data abstraction quality level. Conducting these operations, analysts can select an optimal data abstraction level. Also, analysts can compare different abstraction methods using the measures to see how well relative data density and outliers are maintained, and then select an abstraction method that meets the requirement of their analytic tasks",Qingguang Cui;Matthew O.

Sometimes however, points are generated such that there is additional information available to the reconstruction algorithm. We present Spiraling Edge, a specialized algorithm for surface reconstruction that is three orders of magnitude faster than algorithms for the general case. In addition to sample point locations, our algorithm starts with normal information and knowledge of each point's neighbors. Our algorithm produces a localized approximation to the surface by creating a star-shaped triangulation between a point and a subset of its nearest neighbors. This surface patch is extended by locally triangulating each of the points along the edge of the patch. As each edge point is triangulated, it is removed from the edge and new edge points along the patch's edge are inserted in its place. The updated edge spirals out over the surface until the edge encounters a surface boundary and stops growing in that direction, or until the edge reduces to a small hole that is filled by the final triangle.",Patricia Crossno;Edward Angel,P.

Later approaches handle that shortcoming, but may cause too much clutter to allow flexible exploration to take place. In this work we present a novel hierarchical point placement technique that is capable of dealing with these problems.

The additional seed placement and perceptual challenges introduced by having multiple dynamically deforming objects in the highly unsteady 3D flow domain are addressed. A brief overview of the high speed photogrammetry setup used to capture the dragonfly takeoff, parametric surfaces used for wing reconstruction, CFD solver and underlying flapping flight theory is presented to clarify the importance of several unsteady flight mechanisms, such as the leading edge vortex, that are captured visually. A novel interactive seed placement method is used to simplify the generation of seed curves that stay in the vicinity of relevant flow phenomena as they move with the flapping wings. This method allows a user to define and evaluate the quality of a seed's trajectory over time while working with a single time step. The seed curves are then used to place particles, streamlines and generalized streak lines. The novel concept of flowing seeds is also introduced in order to add visual context about the instantaneous vector fields surrounding smoothly animate streak lines. Tests show this method to be particularly effective at visually capturing vortices that move quickly or that exist for a very brief period of time.

Given a data table, data workers usually need to experience a tedious and time-consuming process to select meaningful combinations of data columns for creating charts. This process is further complicated by the needs of creating dashboards composed of multiple views that unveil different perspectives of data. Existing automated approaches for recommending multiple-view visualizations mainly build on manually crafted design rules, producing sub-optimal or irrelevant suggestions. To address this gap, we present a deep learning approach for selecting data columns and recommending multiple charts. More importantly, we integrate the deep learning models into a mixed-initiative system. Our model could make recommendations given optional user-input selections of data columns. The model, in turn, learns from provenance data of authoring logs in an offline manner.

Scatterplot diagnostics (scagnostics) approaches measure characteristics of scatterplots to automatically find potentially interesting plots, thereby making SPLOMs more scalable with the dimension count. While statistical measures such as regression lines can capture orientation, and graph-theoretic scagnostics measures can capture shape, there is no scatterplot characterization measure that uses both descriptors. Based on well-known results in shape analysis, we propose a scagnostics approach that captures both scatterplot shape and orientation using skeletons (or medial axes). Our representation can handle complex spatial distributions, helps discovery of principal trends in a multiscale way, scales visually well with the number of samples, is robust to noise, and is automatic and fast to compute. We define skeleton-based similarity metrics for the visual exploration and analysis of SPLOMs. We perform a user study to measure the human perception of scatterplot similarity and compare the outcome to our results as well as to graph-based scagnostics and other visual quality metrics.

Particle density is controlled by stochastically injecting and removing particles, taking into account the divergence of the vector field. Alternatively, a uniform density can be maintained by placing exactly one particle in each cell of a uniform grid, which leads to particle-in-cell forward advection. Moreover, we discuss strategies of previous visualization methods for unsteady flow and show how they address issues of spatiotemporal coherence and dense visual representations.

Text-guided generation methods are emerging, but may have limited applicability due to their predefined entities. In this work, we propose ChartSpark, a novel system that embeds semantic context into chart based on text-to-image generative models. ChartSpark generates pictorial visualizations conditioned on both semantic context conveyed in textual inputs and data information embedded in plain charts. The method is generic for both foreground and background pictorial generation, satisfying the design practices identified from empirical research into existing pictorial visualizations. We further develop an interactive visual interface that integrates a text analyzer, editing module, and evaluation module to enable users to generate, modify, and assess pictorial visualizations.

In this paper, we extend this research by isolating factors in personality traits as well as in the visualizations that could have contributed to the observed correlation. We focus on a personality trait known as “locus of control,” which represents a person's tendency to see themselves as controlled by or in control of external events. To isolate variables of the visualization design, we control extraneous factors such as color, interaction, and labeling, and specifically focus on the overall layout style of the visualizations. We conduct a user study with four visualizations that gradually shift from an indentation metaphor to a containment metaphor and compare the participants' speed, accuracy, and preference with their locus of control. Our findings demonstrate that there is indeed a correlation between the two: participants with an internal locus of control perform more poorly with visualizations that employ a containment metaphor, while those with an external locus of control perform well with such visualizations.

We show that representing geometry, attributes, and relationships graphically permits visual pattern recognition skills to be applied to the debugging problem.

This paper describes the ExTreeM-Algorithm: A scalable algorithm for the computation of merge trees via extremum graphs. The core idea of ExTreeM is to first derive the extremum graph $\mathcal{G}$ of an input scalar field $f$ defined on a cell complex $\mathcal{K}$, and subsequently compute the unaugmented merge tree of $f$ on $\mathcal{G}$ instead of $\mathcal{K}$; which are equivalent. Any merge tree algorithm can be carried out significantly faster on $\mathcal{G}$, since $\mathcal{K}$ in general contains substantially more cells than $\mathcal{G}$. To further speed up computation, ExTreeM includes a tailored procedure to derive merge trees of extremum graphs. The computation of the fully augmented merge tree, i.e., a merge tree domain segmentation of $\mathcal{K}$, can then be performed in an optional post-processing step. All steps of ExTreeM consist of procedures with high parallel efficiency, and we provide a formal proof of its correctness. Our experiments, performed on publicly available datasets, report a speedup of up to one order of magnitude over the state-of-the-art algorithms included in the TTK and VTK-m software libraries, while also requiring significantly less memory and exhibiting excellent scaling behavior.",Jonas Lukasczyk;Michael Will;Florian Wetzels;Gunther H.

To navigate these interlinked resources today, one typically selects items from facet lists resulting in abrupt changes from one subset of data to another. While filtering is useful to retrieve results matching specific criteria, it can be difficult to see how facets and items relate and to comprehend the effect of filter operations. In contrast, the PivotPaths interface exposes faceted relations as visual paths in arrangements that invite the viewer to `take a stroll' through an information space. PivotPaths supports pivot operations as lightweight interaction techniques that trigger gradual transitions between views. We designed the interface to allow for casual traversal of large collections in an aesthetically pleasing manner that encourages exploration and serendipitous discoveries.

We can model the bias with the average of the data series and the average of the points drawn along the line. This bias might arise because higher variability leads to stronger weighting in the average calculation, either due to the longer line segments (even though those segments contain the same number of data values) or line segments with higher variability being otherwise more visually salient.

Such dynamic displays put a demand on our visual processing capacities, yet our perception of motion is limited. Several techniques have been shown to improve the processing of dynamic displays. Staging the animation to sequentially show steps in a transition and tracing object movement by displaying trajectory histories can improve processing by reducing the cognitive load. In this paper, We examine the effectiveness of staging and tracing in dynamic displays. We showed participants animated line charts depicting the movements of lines and asked them to identify the line with the highest mean and variance. We manipulated the animation to display the lines with or without staging, tracing and history, and compared the results to a static chart as a control. Results showed that tracing and staging are preferred by participants, and improve their performance in mean and variance tasks respectively. They also preferred display time 3 times shorter when staging is used. Also, encoding animation speed with mean and variance in congruent tasks is associated with higher accuracy. These findings help inform real-world best practices for building dynamic displays.

Consequently, recent years have seen various set visualization approaches that visually connect points of the same category to support users in understanding the spatial distribution of categories. Existing methods use complex and often highly irregular shapes to connect points of the same category, leading to high cognitive load for the user. In this paper we introduce SimpleSets, which uses simple shapes to enclose categorical point patterns, thereby providing a clean overview of the data distribution. SimpleSets is designed to visualize sets of points with a single categorical attribute; as a result, the point patterns enclosed by SimpleSets form a partition of the data. We give formal definitions of point patterns that correspond to simple shapes and describe an algorithm that partitions categorical points into few such patterns. Our second contribution is a rendering algorithm that transforms a given partition into a clean set of shapes resulting in an aesthetically pleasing set visualization. Our algorithm pays particular attention to resolving intersections between nearby shapes in a consistent manner.

Many of these tools have been designed through collaborations with urban experts, aiming to distill intricate urban analysis workflows into interactive visualizations and interfaces. However, the design, implementation, and practical use of these tools still rely on siloed approaches, resulting in bespoke systems that are difficult to reproduce and extend. At the design level, these tools undervalue rich data workflows from urban experts, typically treating them only as data providers and evaluators. At the implementation level, they lack interoperability with other technical frameworks. At the practical use level, they tend to be narrowly focused on specific fields, inadvertently creating barriers to cross-domain collaboration. To address these gaps, we present Curio, a framework for collaborative urban visual analytics. Curio uses a dataflow model with multiple abstraction levels (code, grammar, GUI elements) to facilitate collaboration across the design and implementation of visual analytics components. The framework allows experts to intertwine data preprocessing, management, and visualization stages while tracking the provenance of code and visualizations. In collaboration with urban experts, we evaluate Curio through a diverse set of usage scenarios targeting urban accessibility, urban microclimate, and sunlight access.

As use case, we consider the research groups of a university faculty as elements, and the departments and joint research projects as sets. We aim at finding a suitable mapping between the research groups and the grid cells such that the department structure forms a base map layout. Our objectives are to optimize both the compactness of the entirety of all cells and of each set by itself. We show that computing the mapping is NP-hard.

The similarities are calculated using three key factors, namely, co-authorships, publication venues, and temporal information. Our system estimates all possible allocations, and then provides visual cues to users to help them validate every ambiguous case. By looping users in the disambiguation process, our system can achieve more reliable results than general data mining models for highly ambiguous cases. In addition, once an ambiguous case is resolved, the result is instantly added back to our system and serves as additional cues for all the remaining unidentified names. In this way, we open up the black box in traditional disambiguation processes, and help intuitively and comprehensively explain why the corresponding classifications should hold.

It reveals clusters of high-dimensional data points at different scales while only requiring minimal tuning of its parameters. However, the computational complexity of the algorithm limits its application to relatively small datasets. To address this problem, several evolutions of t-SNE have been developed in recent years, mainly focusing on the scalability of the similarity computations between data points. However, these contributions are insufficient to achieve interactive rates when visualizing the evolution of the t-SNE embedding for large datasets. In this work, we present a novel approach to the minimization of the t-SNE objective function that heavily relies on graphics hardware and has linear computational complexity. Our technique decreases the computational cost of running t-SNE on datasets by orders of magnitude and retains or improves on the accuracy of past approximated techniques. We propose to approximate the repulsive forces between data points by splatting kernel textures for each data point. This approximation allows us to reformulate the t-SNE minimization problem as a series of tensor operations that can be efficiently executed on the graphics card.

The famous Simpson's paradox is such a phenomenon where aggregated and subgroup-level associations contradict with each other, causing cognitive confusions and difficulty in making adequate interpretations and decisions. Existing tools provide little insights for humans to locate, reason about, and prevent pitfalls of spurious association in practice. We propose VISPUR, a visual analytic system that provides a causal analysis framework and a human-centric workflow for tackling spurious associations.

The basic problem is that, just as 2D shadows of 3D curves lose structure where lines cross, 3D graphics projections of smooth 4D topological surfaces are interrupted where one surface intersects another. Furthermore, if one attempts to trace real knotted ropes or a plastic models of self-intersecting surfaces with a fingertip, one inevitably collides with parts of the physical artifact. In this work, we exploit the free motion of a computer-based haptic probe to support a continuous motion that follows the local continuity of the object being explored. For our principal test case of 4D-embedded surfaces projected to 3D, this permits us to follow the full local continuity of the surface as though in fact we were touching an actual 4D object. We exploit additional sensory cues to provide supplementary or redundant information. For example, we can use audio tags to note the relative 4D depth of illusory 3D surface intersections produced by projection from 4D, as well as providing automated refinement of the tactile exploration path to eliminate jitter and snagging, resulting in a much cleaner exploratory motion than a bare uncorrected motion. Visual enhancements provide still further improvement to the feedback: by opening a view-direction-defined cutaway into the interior of the 3D surface projection, we allow the viewer to keep the haptic probe continuously in view as it traverses any touchable part of the object. Finally, we extend the static tactile exploration framework using a dynamic mode that links each stylus motion to a change in orientation that creates at each instant a maximal-area screen projection of a neighborhood of the current point of interest. This minimizes 4D distortion and permits true metric sizes to be deduced locally at any point. All these methods combine to reveal the full richness of the complex spatial relationships of the target shapes, and to overcome many expected perceptual limitations in 4D visualization.",Andrew J.

Beichman et al., 1999). The goal of this mission is to search for chemical signatures of life in distant solar systems using five satellites flying in formation to simulate a large telescope. To design and visually verify such a delicate mission, one has to analyze and interact with many different 3D spacecraft trajectories, which is often difficult in 2D. We employ a novel trajectory design approach using invariant manifold theory, which is best understood and utilized in an immersive setting. The visualization also addresses multi-scale issues related to the vast differences in distance, velocity, and time at different phases of the mission. Additionally, the parameterization and coordinate frames used for numerical simulations may not be suitable for direct visualization. Relative motion presents a more serious problem where the patterns of the trajectories can only be viewed in particular rotating frames. Some of these problems are greatly relieved by using interactive, animated stereo 3D visualization in a semi-immersive environment such as a Responsive Workbench.

To better understand the needs of this user group, we conduct a technical observation study of 50 public repositories of data and analysis code authored by 33 professional journalists at 26 news organizations. We develop two detailed and cross-cutting taxonomies of data wrangling in computational journalism, for actions and for processes.

We develop a concise, actionable framework for general multi-table data wrangling that includes wrangling operations documented in our taxonomy that are without clear parallels in other work.

Recent work on accelerating such techniques has focused on preprocessing the volume data or postprocessing the extracted polygonization. The algorithm presented, concentrates instead on streamlining the surface extraction process itself so as to accelerate the rendering of large volumes. The technique shortens the conventional isosurface visualization pipeline by eliminating the intermediate polygonization. We compute the contribution of the isosurface within a volume cell to the resulting image directly from a simplified numerical description of the cell/surface intersection. The approach also reduces the work in the remaining stages of the visualization process. By quantizing the volume data, we exploit precomputed and cached data at key processing steps to improve rendering efficiency.

This polygon is then used to create a room for which the polygon serves as the floor and the ceiling. With our system that implements Möbius transformations, the user can interactively edit the scene and see the reflections of the edited objects.

To preserve the expressiveness of the visual representation, a placed label should neither occlude other labels nor visual representatives (e.g., icons, lines) that communicate crucial information. Optimal, non-overlapping labeling is an NP-hard problem. Thus, only a few approaches achieve a fast non-overlapping labeling in highly interactive scenarios like information visualization. These approaches generally target the point-feature label placement (PFLP) problem, solving only label-label conflicts. This paper presents a new, fast, solid and flexible 2D labeling approach for the PFLP problem that additionally respects other visual elements and the visual extent of labeled features. The results (number of placed labels, processing time) of our particle-based method compare favorably to those of existing techniques. Although the esthetic quality of non-real-time approaches may not be achieved with our method, it complies with practical demands and thus supports the interactive exploration of information spaces.

Particle behavior is dynamic and can be based on laws of physics or artificial rules. For isosurface extraction, we program particles to be attracted towards a specific surface value while simultaneously repelling adjacent particles. The repulsive forces are based on the curvature of the surface at that location. A birth-death process results in a denser concentration of particles in areas of high curvature and sparser populations in areas of lower curvature. The overall level of detail is controlled through a scaling factor that increases or decreases the repulsive forces of the particles. Once particles reach equilibrium, their locations are used as vertices in generating a triangular mesh of the surface. The advantages of our approach include: vertex densities are based on surface features rather than on the sampling rate of the volume; a single scaling factor simplifies level-of-detail control; and meshing is efficient because it uses neighbor information that has already been generated during the force calculations.",Patricia Crossno;Edward Angel,P.

The time-consuming video production caused by the manual delineation of structures, software based volume rendering, and the interactive definition of an optimized camera path is considerably improved with a fully automatic strategy. Therefore, a previously suggested approach (C. Rezk-Salama, 2000) is applied which uses an optimized transfer function as a template and automatically adapts it to an individual dataset. Furthermore, we introduce hardware-accelerated morphologic filtering in order to detect the location of mid-size and giant aneurysms. The actual generation of the video is finally integrated into a hardware accelerated off-screen rendering process based on 3D texture mapping, ensuring fast visualization of high quality.

We present a method based on finite element approximations which combines these two approaches in a new and unique way that is conceptually simple and theoretically sound. The main idea is to consider mesh reduction as an approximation problem in appropriate finite element spaces. Starting with a very coarse triangulation of the functional domain, a hierarchy of highly non-uniform tetrahedral (or triangular in 2D) meshes is generated adaptively by local refinement. This process is driven by controlling the local error of the piecewise linear finite element approximation of the function on each mesh element. A reliable and efficient computation of the global approximation error and a multilevel preconditioned conjugate gradient solver are the key components of the implementation. In order to analyze the properties and advantages of the adaptively generated tetrahedral meshes, we implemented two volume visualization algorithms: an iso-surface extractor and a ray-caster. Both algorithms, while conceptually simple, show significant speedups over conventional methods delivering comparable rendering quality from adaptively compressed datasets.",Roberto Grosso;Christoph Lürig;Thomas Ertl,R.

Prior literature offers guidelines for effective colormap design, such as emphasizing luminance variation while limiting changes in hue. However, empirical studies of color are largely focused on perceptual tasks. This narrow focus inhibits our understanding of how generalizable these guidelines are, particularly to tasks like visual inference that require synthesis and judgement across multiple percepts. Furthermore, the emphasis on traditional ramp designs (e.g., sequential or diverging) may sideline other key metrics or design strategies. We study how a cognitive metric-color name variation-impacts people's ability to make model-based judgments. In two graphical inference experiments, participants saw a series of color-coded scalar fields sampled from different models and assessed the relationships between these models. Contrary to conventional guidelines, participants were more accurate when viewing colormaps that cross a variety of uniquely nameable colors. We modeled participants' performance using this metric and found that it provides a better fit to the experimental data than do existing design principles. Our findings indicate cognitive advantages for colorful maps like rainbow, which exhibit high color categorization, despite their traditionally undesirable perceptual properties. We also found no evidence that color categorization would lead observers to infer false data features. Our results provide empirically grounded metrics for predicting a colormap's performance and suggest alternative guidelines for designing new quantitative colormaps to support inference.

Evidence is collected, collated and cross-linked with our existing knowledge. In the process, a myriad of analytical and visualisation techniques are employed to generate a visual representation of the data. These often introduce their own uncertainties, in addition to the ones inherent in the data, and these propagated and compounded uncertainties can result in impaired decision making. The user's confidence or trust in the results depends on the extent of user's awareness of the underlying uncertainties generated on the system side. This paper unpacks the uncertainties that propagate through visual analytics systems, illustrates how human's perceptual and cognitive biases influence the user's awareness of such uncertainties, and how this affects the user's trust building. The knowledge generation model for visual analytics is used to provide a terminology and framework to discuss the consequences of these aspects in knowledge construction and though examples, machine uncertainty is compared to human trust measures with provenance. Furthermore, guidelines for the design of uncertainty-aware systems are presented that can aid the user in better decision making.",Dominik Sacha;Hansi Senaratne;Bum Chul Kwon;Geoffrey P.

For multivariate graphs, a remaining challenge is to cope with the attributes that are associated with nodes and edges. Addressing this challenge, we propose responsive matrix cells as a focus+context approach for embedding additional interactive views into a matrix. Responsive matrix cells are local zoomable regions of interest that provide auxiliary data exploration and editing facilities for multivariate graphs. They behave responsively by adapting their visual contents to the cell location, the available display space, and the user task. Responsive matrix cells enable users to reveal details about the graph, compare node and edge attributes, and edit data values directly in a matrix without resorting to external views or tools. We report the general design considerations for responsive matrix cells covering the visual and interactive means necessary to support a seamless data exploration and editing. Responsive matrix cells have been implemented in a web-based prototype based on which we demonstrate the utility of our approach.

In this paper, we propose a new multidimensional visualization technique named a value and relation (VaR) display, together with a rich set of navigation and selection tools, for interactive exploration of datasets with up to hundreds of dimensions. By explicitly conveying the relationships among the dimensions of a high dimensional dataset, the VaR display helps users grasp the associations among dimensions. By using pixel-oriented techniques to present values of the data items in a condensed manner, the VaR display reveals data patterns in the dataset using as little screen space as possible. The navigation and selection tools enable users to interactively reduce clutter, navigate within the dimension space, and examine data value details within context effectively and efficiently. The VaR display scales well to datasets with large numbers of data items by employing sampling and texture mapping.

A new technique, extended from Lagrangian-Eulerian Advection, is presented to help understand the variation of vertical motion associated with the change in thermocline depth over time. A time surface is correctly deformed in a single direction according to the flow. The evolution of the time surface is computed via a mixture of Eulerian and Lagrangian techniques. The dominant horizontal motion is textured onto the surface using texture advection, while both the horizontal and vertical motions are used to displace the surface.

We adopt a storytelling approach for complex scenarios from both first and third-person perspectives, integrating action visualizations.

Resulting surfaces consist of collections of manifold patches joined along nonmanifold curves and vertices.

Mobility data sets characterize the variation of the presence of people in different places over time as well as movements (or flows) of people between the places. The analysis of mobility data is challenging due to the need to analyze and compare spatial situations (i.e., presence and flows of people at certain time moments) and to gain an understanding of the spatio-temporal changes (variations of situations over time). Traditional flow visualizations usually fail due to massive clutter. Modern approaches offer limited support for investigating the complex variation of the movements over longer time periods. We propose a visual analytics methodology that solves these issues by combined spatial and temporal simplifications. We have developed a graph-based method, called MobilityGraphs, which reveals movement patterns that were occluded in flow maps. Our method enables the visual representation of the spatio-temporal variation of movements for long time series of spatial situations originally containing a large number of intersecting flows. The interactive system supports data exploration from various perspectives and at various levels of detail by interactive setting of clustering parameters. The feasibility our approach was tested on aggregated mobility data derived from a set of geolocated Twitter posts within the Greater London city area and mobile phone call data records in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

A further step in this direction was the creation of three-dimensional (3D) displays which have amplified the fidelity of digital representations. However, there are no systematic results evaluating the extent to which 3D displays better support cognitive spatial abilities. The aim of this research is to empirically investigate spatial memory performance across different instances of 2D and 3D displays. Two experiments were performed.

A simulation ensemble is a collection of simulation runs of the same simulation model using different sets of control parameters. Complex engineering systems have very large parameter spaces so a naïve sampling can result in prohibitively large simulation ensembles. Interactive steering of simulation ensembles provides the means to select relevant points in a multi-dimensional parameter space (design of experiment). Interactive steering efficiently reduces the number of simulation runs needed by coupling simulation and visualization and allowing a user to request new simulations on the fly. As system complexity grows, a pure interactive solution is not always sufficient. The new approach of hybrid steering combines interactive visual steering with automatic optimization. Hybrid steering allows a domain expert to interactively (in a visualization) select data points in an iterative manner, approximate the values in a continuous region of the simulation space (by regression) and automatically find the “best” points in this continuous region based on the specified constraints and objectives (by optimization). We argue that with the full spectrum of optimization options, the steering process can be improved substantially. We describe an integrated system consisting of a simulation, a visualization, and an optimization component. We also describe typical tasks and propose an interactive analysis workflow for complex engineering systems. We demonstrate our approach on a case study from automotive industry, the optimization of a hydraulic circuit in a high pressure common rail Diesel injection system.",Kresimir Matkovic;Denis Gracanin;Rainer Splechtna;Mario Jelovic;Benedikt Stehno;Helwig Hauser;Werner Purgathofer,Kreŝimir Matković;Denis Gračanin;Rainer Splechtna;Mario Jelović;Benedikt Stehno;Helwig Hauser;Werner Purgathofer,"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria;Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA;VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria;AVL-AST Zagreb, Croatia;VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria;University of Bergen, Norway;Vienna University of Technology, Austria",10.1109/tvcg.2010.223;10.1109/tvcg.2012.280;10.1109/tvcg.2008.145;10.1109/tvcg.2009.110;10.1109/tvcg.2010.171;10.1109/vast.2009.5333081;10.1109/vast.2010.5651694;10.1109/tvcg.2010.223,"Interactive Visual Analysis, Integrated Design Environment, Simulation, Visual Steering, Automatic Optimization",31.0,25.0,42.0,946.0,,,simulation visualization optimization;steering automatic;domain expert;pressure common rail;argue spectrum,0.6506;0.2198;0.1953;0.1457;-0.0060,"[np.int64(-1), -1, -1, -1, -1]",6;-1;-1;-1;-1,6,6,Interactive Optimization Visualization

Our work is motivated by the analysis of image data acquired using micro-computed tomography ($\mu\text{CT}$) of ancient, rolled and folded thin-layer structures such as papyrus, parchment, and paper as well as silver and lead sheets. From these documents we know that they are 2-dimensional (2D) in nature. Hence, we are particularly interested in reconstructing 2D manifolds that approximate the document's structure. The image data from which we want to reconstruct the 2D manifolds are often very noisy and represent folded, densely-layered structures with many artifacts, such as ruptures or layer splitting and merging. Previous ridge-surface extraction methods fail to extract the desired 2D manifold for such challenging data. We have therefore developed a novel method to extract 2D manifolds. The proposed method uses a local fast marching scheme in combination with a separation of the region covered by fast marching into two sub-regions. The 2D manifold of interest is then extracted as the surface separating the two sub-regions. The local scheme can be applied for both automatic propagation as well as interactive analysis.

The study is motivated by critical questions such as: what are the differences between positive and negative reviews? What is the origin of a particular opinion? How do these opinions change over time? To what extent can differentiating features be identified from unstructured text? How accurately can these features predict the category of a review? We first analyze terminology variations in these reviews in terms of syntactic, semantic, and statistic associations identified by TermWatch and use term variation patterns to depict underlying topics. We then select the most predictive terms based on log likelihood tests and demonstrate that this small set of terms classifies over 70% of the conflicting reviews correctly. This feature selection process reduces the dimensionality of the feature space from more than 20,000 dimensions to a couple of hundreds.

In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Volume Lines for the interactive visual analysis and comparison of sets of 3D volumes. Each volume is linearized along a Hilbert space-filling curve into a 1D Hilbert line plot, which depicts the intensities over the Hilbert indices. We present a nonlinear scaling of these 1D Hilbert line plots based on the intensity variations in the ensemble of 3D volumes, which enables a more effective use of the available screen space. The nonlinear scaling builds the basis for our interactive visualization techniques. An interactive histogram heatmap of the intensity frequencies serves as overview visualization. When zooming in, the frequencies are replaced by detailed 1D Hilbert line plots and optional functional boxplots. To focus on important regions of the volume ensemble, nonlinear scaling is incorporated into the plots. An interactive scaling widget depicts the local ensemble variations. Our brushing and linking interface reveals, for example, regions with a high ensemble variation by showing the affected voxels in a 3D spatial view. We show the applicability of our concepts using two case studies on ensembles of 3D volumes resulting from tomographic reconstruction. In the first case study, we evaluate an artificial specimen from simulated industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography (XCT). In the second case study, a real-world XCT foam specimen is investigated.

SciVis,2015,Real-time Uncertainty Visualization for B-Mode Ultrasound,10.1109/scivis.2015.7429489,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429489,33.0,40.0,C,"B-mode ultrasound is a very well established imaging modality and is widely used in many of today's clinical routines. However, acquiring good images and interpreting them correctly is a challenging task due to the complex ultrasound image formation process depending on a large number of parameters. To facilitate ultrasound acquisitions, we introduce a novel framework for real-time uncertainty visualization in B-mode images. We compute real-time per-pixel ultrasound Confidence Maps, which we fuse with the original ultrasound image in order to provide the user with an interactive feedback on the quality and credibility of the image. In addition to a standard color overlay mode, primarily intended for educational purposes, we propose two perceptional visualization schemes to be used in clinical practice. Our mapping of uncertainty to chroma uses the perceptionally uniform L*a*b* color space to ensure that the perceived brightness of B-mode ultrasound remains the same. The alternative mapping of uncertainty to fuzziness keeps the B-mode image in its original grayscale domain and locally blurs or sharpens the image based on the uncertainty distribution. An elaborate evaluation of our system and user studies on both medical students and expert sonographers demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed technique. In particular for ultrasound novices, such as medical students, our technique yields powerful visual cues to evaluate the image quality and thereby learn the ultrasound image formation process. Furthermore, seeing the distribution of uncertainty adjust to the transducer positioning in real-time, provides also expert clinicians with a strong visual feedback on their actions. This helps them to optimize the acoustic window and can improve the general clinical value of ultrasound.",Christian Schulte zu Berge;Denis Declara;Christoph Hennersperger;Maximilian Baust;Nassir Navab,Christian Schulte Zu Berge;Denis Declara;Christoph Hennersperger;Maximilian Baust;Nassir Navab,;;;;,10.1109/visual.2001.964550;10.1109/tvcg.2006.134;10.1109/tvcg.2007.70518;10.1109/tvcg.2012.279;10.1109/tvcg.2009.114;10.1109/visual.2001.964550,"Ultrasound, Uncertainty Visualization, Confidence Maps, Real-time",2.0,3.0,23.0,436.0,,,ultrasound confidence maps;color overlay mode;blurs sharpens image;improve general clinical;task,0.6866;0.3184;0.2482;0.1806;0.0559,"[np.int64(-1), -1, -1, -1, -1]",-1;-1;-1;-1;-1,,-1,Advanced Visualization Techniques
InfoVis,2013,Selecting the Aspect Ratio of a Scatter Plot Based on Its Delaunay Triangulation,10.1109/tvcg.2013.187,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.187,2326.0,2335.0,J,"Scatter plots are diagrams that visualize two-dimensional data as sets of points in the plane. They allow users to detect correlations and clusters in the data. Whether or not a user can accomplish these tasks highly depends on the aspect ratio selected for the plot, i.e., the ratio between the horizontal and the vertical extent of the diagram. We argue that an aspect ratio is good if the Delaunay triangulation of the scatter plot at this aspect ratio has some nice geometric property, e.g., a large minimum angle or a small total edge length. More precisely, we consider the following optimization problem. Given a set Q of points in the plane, find a scale factor s such that scaling the x-coordinates of the points in Q by s and the y-coordinates by 1=s yields a point set P(s) that optimizes a property of the Delaunay triangulation of P(s), over all choices of s. We present an algorithm that solves this problem efficiently and demonstrate its usefulness on real-world instances. Moreover, we discuss an empirical test in which we asked 64 participants to choose the aspect ratios of 18 scatter plots. We tested six different quality measures that our algorithm can optimize. In conclusion, minimizing the total edge length and minimizing what we call the 'uncompactness' of the triangles of the Delaunay triangulation yielded the aspect ratios that were most similar to those chosen by the participants in the test.",Martin Fink 0001;Jan-Henrik Haunert;Joachim Spoerhase;Alexander Wolff 0001,Martin Fink;Jan-Henrik Haunert;Joachim Spoerhase;Alexander Wolff,"Lehrstuhl I, Institut für Informatik, Universität Würzburg, Germany;Lehrstuhl I, Institut für Informatik, Universität Würzburg, Germany;Lehrstuhl I, Institut für Informatik, Universität Würzburg, Germany;Lehrstuhl I, Institut für Informatik, Universität Würzburg, Germany",10.1109/tvcg.2006.163;10.1109/tvcg.2012.196;10.1109/tvcg.2011.167;10.1109/tvcg.2006.163,"Scatter plot, aspect ratio, Delaunay triangulation",35.0,24.0,28.0,727.0,,,delaunay triangulation scatter;choose aspect ratios;clusters data;efficiently demonstrate usefulness;allow,0.6072;0.3702;0.3686;0.1983;-0.0029,"[np.int64(-1), -1, -1, -1, -1]",11;-1;-1;-1;-1,11,11,Geometric Visualization Techniques

Research into visual analytics tools to support the discovery of patterns in event data often focuses on the spatiotemporal or spatiomultivariate dimension of the data only. Few research efforts focus on all three dimensions in one framework. An integral view on all three dimensions is, however, required to unlock the full potential of event datasets. In this poster, we present an event visualization, transition, and interaction framework that enables an integral view on all dimensions of spatiotemporal multivariate event data. The framework is built around the notion that the event data space can be considered a spatiotemporal multivariate hypercube. Results of a case study we performed suggest that a visual analytics tool based on the proposed framework is indeed capable to support users in the discovery of multidimensional spatiotemporal multivariate patterns in event data.",Fred Olislagers;Marcel Worring,Fred Olislagers;Marcel Worring,"Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands;Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands",,,3.0,1.0,3.0,206.0,,,event visualization;spatiomultivariate dimension data;framework built notion;study performed suggest;unlock,0.7077;0.4763;0.0467;0.0456;-0.0202,"[np.int64(-1), -1, -1, -1, -1]",-1;-1;-1;-1;-1,,-1,Advanced Visualization Techniques
